From now on all the solution of the picogym CTF will be uploaded and posted here. I am a noob in Cyber Security and I am starting this journey to solve this 271 problems in next 271 days.

Now let's get started with our very first challange, Obedient cat. Click on the webshell button to open up the terminal.

Go to your webshell and write wget, then press ctrl+shift+v to paste the download link. it will download and save the file.

You can then type "ls" to show all the lists of available file that you have in your system. You can see below list where you can find a file called flag.

Wait, what? Flag!? I wonder what's inside of it. Let's check what do we have inside the file by typing a command "cat file_name". As the name of the file for this one is flag, the command will be like below,

Voila! You got the first ever flag for the picoCTF picogym! Congrats! Now copy this flag and paste it to submit the flag. Woohoo, wait a go hacker!
No wonder why this problem is called Obedient "cat". All the problem of picoCTF gym has a specific moto, to let us know a certain command or maybe some certain vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is totally okay to look for the solution of these problems because only solving the problem is not the target but the knowledge.

What too easy? Is it too boring? Hold your horses. There are 270 more challenges for us to conquer. The game has just began. Welcome to your new journey! Say hello to your new world!
